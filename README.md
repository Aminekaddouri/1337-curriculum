### 🧱 &nbsp;C Track

Core systems programming in C — memory, pointers, concurrency, and performance.

#### 🔹 [libft](./c/libft)
> Recreated essential C library functions (`strlen`, `atoi`, `memcpy`, etc.) — the foundation of all 1337 projects.

#### 🔹 [get-next-line](./c/get-next-line)
> Implemented a function to read a line from a file descriptor using static variables and dynamic buffers.

#### 🔹 [ft-printf](./c/ft-printf)
> Built a custom `printf` with support for `%s`, `%d`, `%x`, `%p`, and variadic arguments.

#### 🔹 [push-swap](./c/push-swap)
> Algorithm challenge: sort integers using two stacks and minimal moves. Includes a visualizer.

#### 🔹 [minitalk](./c/minitalk)
> Signal-based messaging app using `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` to send strings from client to server.

#### 🔹 [so-long](./c/so-long)
> 2D puzzle game using MLX42 — collect items and reach the exit.

#### 🔹 [cub3D](./c/cub3D)
> Raycasting 3D engine in **C** with textured walls, minimap, and movement. Built using MLX42.

#### 🔹 [minishell](./c/minishell)
> A fully functional Unix shell in **C** with command parsing, pipes, redirections, environment variables, and signal handling.

#### 🔹 [philosophers](./c/philosophers)
> Multithreaded simulation of the Dining Philosophers problem using **pthreads** in **C** — solved deadlock and race conditions.

---

### 🧱 &nbsp;C++ & OOP

Object-oriented programming and modern C++ concepts.

#### 🔹 [cpp](./cpp/cpp)
> Completed 42’s C++ modules (00–09): classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions, and STL containers.

---

### 🔗 &nbsp;Networking

Hands-on networking fundamentals.

#### 🔹 [netPractice](./networking/netPractice)
> Completed 10 levels of networking exercises covering TCP/IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and network configuration.
> - Simulated network troubleshooting
> - Configured IP addresses, gateways, and routing tables
> - Validated connectivity and resolved misconfigurations

### 🏁 &nbsp;About 1337

1337 (42 Network) is a tuition-free, peer-driven coding school focused on **project-based learning**, **autonomy**, and **problem-solving**. There are no teachers — only projects, peer reviews, and relentless practice.

This curriculum has taught me:
- How to learn independently and debug complex systems
- How to write clean, efficient, and resilient code
- How to manage memory, processes, and threads at a low level
- How to think like an engineer
